                          <p class="text-muted">A lot have changed on my physical features. I have grown facial hair and became slimmer than before. As I perceive to others, my eyes and long eyelashes are the assets that I have. Others say that I might have inherited a lot of my dad’s physical feature as I do resemble my dad. I do have a poor healthy lifestyle before but now I realize that I must be fit and healthy. I have become more mature and developed my skills and ways of expressing myself such as singing and broadcasting. </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">Being exposed to a multi-gendered environment, I learned how to respect and value other people's gender orientation. Whenever I am surrounded by girls, I feel anxious and embarrassed. I experienced this kind of feeling when I was in my elementary to early junior high school until my senior high school years came that most influenced me from who I am now. Many things have changed and I became open to people whom I collaborate with. Since I don’t have anyone to introduce as my partner, I placed here two of my celebrity crush, Elle Fanning and Chloe Moretz. I do have a girl best friend and I've been with her since junior high school. We have the same interests and we also belong to the same squad. I know she won’t see this but I’ve already confessed to her that I liked her and she has the same feelings too. Unfortunately, I don’t know if I’m a coward or what since I told her that I’m not ready as I still don’t have anything to prove yet. :<</p>

                          <p class="text-muted">Many factors may contribute to influencing the cultural dimension of self. Such examples are the environment, family, friends, and peers; and religion. I think culture has a great impact to the holistic development of oneself. It could lead to the influential development of the physical, emotional, social, mental and spiritual aspects of me. In each chapter of life there are new different friends and acquaintances that arrives but those old ones are the treasures. </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">As a social being, socializing with people will help me develop my being. Being engaged with other people could also lessen the thinking of loneliness. But I could also feel alone, even if I’m in an ingroup, when no one is not noticing me. Luckily, my current friends don’t have that kind of idea. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, it would be impossible to interact with other people like we normally do before. That is why, we use the means of technology to inspire and collaborate with other people. On social media, most of my posts and content on my account are about bible verses to give hope to other people to live life even though we have supplications. Before, I was not actually active in social media but now I’ve developed a new routine wherein I always engage myself in the digital world. </p>

By intensive practice every day and getting inspiration to other people who are with the same track as mine. Practicing these gifts of talents and learning, soon, after creating a system, you’ll realize you are doing and applying it effectively and efficiently without actually knowing it or without conscious effort. After practicing, the next thing that I should do is being consistent for me to maintain all the hard work and effort that I invested to a certain acquired knowledge. I decided to study in Mapua University as I expect that it will give me a better future. </p>

                          <p class="text-muted">Stress is a normal part of life. Anytime it could be triggered by a certain stimulus. When I feel down, I become more emotional inside and sleep more often. I tend to overthink the situation I am in, which makes me less productive. Being depressed and suicide is never an option. The last time that I was downhearted and shocked was when one of my best friends did a suicide act. Every time I think of him, I realize that I lacked in something that I don’t know and failed to help him. However, as of now, I might have recovered but the pain is still in there but it teaches me something that I must and must not do in the future. 
                          </p>
                          <P>
                          As seen in the picture below, whenever I feel stressed to school works and other situations, I tend to lose weight but I eat and sleep more often. I try to call my friends or talk to my family to divert my attention to relax and rest my mind. When my anxiety is severe, I tend to listen to uplifting and motivational music just like the link below. I’ve learned things on our Understanding the Self class the ways on how to manage anxiety such as looking around and naming feasible things to make you busy and to inhale some fresh air from a window.

                          <p class="text-muted">I grew up in a family that is religiously oriented and have fear in God. I believe that we have our inner souls that lie deep inside our beings but a different entity from our physical state. It dictates us our conscience whether what we are doing is right or wrong. It is said in the Bible that there is a man who is dead physically but has life spiritually while the other kind of person is alive physically but dead in their spiritual being. Our physical being is just temporary and can perish while our spiritual soul could attain eternal life if we follow God’s will. That is why we should desire attaining eternal life in heaven rather than being attached to this sinful perishable world.
                            </p>
                          <p>As seen in the picture above I decided to become a choir member and serve God by singing praises. I also joined BRead Society or Bible Readers Society that is a well-known organization locally and internationally.

                            <h4 class="text-muted">DISCOVERING LIFE'S MEANING</h4>
                            <p class="text-muted">I was baptized in <b>Members Church of God International</b> and became a member when I was 15 years old. Indoctrinated at an early age, it introduced to me the wisdom from the Bible and it took me away from vices and evil pleasures of this world. A lifetime here on Earth is not enough to serve God. I also learned in my religion that faith alone doesn't mean salvation, but it needs it to come with good deeds and love for others. After being baptized, I joined a committee in our church and became a member of the largest gospel choir in the world – MCGI Chorale. We cannot repay all the good things that God has given us as He is eternal and we’re not, but we should offer Him our lives by serving and thanking Him with songs of praises, act of good deeds and prayers. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                            I believe that everything that happens in life has its purpose, just like what is happening right now in the pandemic. God has given us opportunity to do good deeds to other people who are in need and also for men to repent to their sins. I still have a lot to say about my experiences and discoveries in my stay in my religion, yet I do not know how to put it by word, but it lies on my heart and mind. I believe that being satisfied in life on what you have is the best way of lifestyle here on earth. Being satisfied in a way that you don’t waste money for perishable treasures here on earth but by investing eternal treasures in heaven by doing good deeds.

                            When I was in Senior High School, I decided to take the academic strand STEM or the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand since I think that it would give me a better career in the future. As of now, I am taking Computer Science since I know some of my friends, who graduated in the same track as mine, are now prosperous in life. In the future, even though I’m not sure about it, I want to be a multimedia software engineer or maybe a 3d motion graphic artist. I hope that I, together with my classmates and batchmates, can pull this off SOON and pursue our careers even though there is pandemic that threatening our lives.
